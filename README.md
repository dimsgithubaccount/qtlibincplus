# qtlibincplus
this pro realize the most functions from Qt, i want to imitate Qt-frameware by original C++, a exiting way to learn Qt ideology. notice that this is only a testing code, i would be flattered that someone would refer to it or even quote it(impossible, code like a piece of shit perhaps), if possible, don't forget starr me!
